Welcome! I will be joining as a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the
[**Discovery Partners Institute**](https://dpi.uillinois.edu/) (DPI) at the
University of Illinois in August 2022. My PhD research was done at the
Department of [**Electrical and Computer
Engineering**](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois. My
dissertation focused on geometric & topological methods for analysis of high
dimensional timeseries data. My interests are in systems theory, dynamics &
data analytics, neuroscience and controls. For my post-doc term, I will be
working with the [Hearing Health Institute](https://dpi.uillinois.edu/hearing-health-institute/) science team at DPI. 

I obtained my Masters in [**Mechanical Science &
Engineering**](https://mechse.illinois.edu/) from Illinois in 2017 and my
Bachelor of Science in [**Mechanical
Engineering**](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/index.html) from Texas
A&M University in 2014. For my post-doc term, I will be working with the
[**Hearing Health
Institute**](https://dpi.uillinois.edu/hearing-health-institute/) science team
at DPI. I also have a life long love of programming, technology and pet dogs.

I frequently served as Teaching Assistant for my departments. In the past, I
have taught the laboratory section of [**Engineering
Materials**](https://mechse.illinois.edu/graduate/graduate-course-offerings/ME330)
and assisted in teaching courses in [**Introduction to
Electronics**](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/ece110),
undergraduate [**Control
Systems**](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece486/sp2018/), graduate
[**Control Systems**](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/ece515),
[**Adaptive & Nonlinear
Control**](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/ece517) as well as a
course in the analysis of [**Nonlinear
Systems**](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/ece528). A few years ago,
I also helped organize the 2018 [**CSL Student
Conference**](https://publish.illinois.edu/cslstudentconference2018/).
